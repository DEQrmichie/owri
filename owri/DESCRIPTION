Description: owri is a package to simplfy query and summarization of project data in the Oregon Watershed Restoration Inventory (OWRI) database. The OWRI database is managed by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and originated with the Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds. The majority of OWRI entries represent voluntary actions of private citizens and landowners who have worked in partnership with federal, state, and local groups to improve aquatic habitat and water quality conditions. OWRI is the single largest restoration information database in the Western United States with more than 17,000 completed projects reported since 1995.
