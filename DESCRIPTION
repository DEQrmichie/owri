Description: owri is a R package to simplfy access, query, and summarization of 
             project data from the Oregon Watershed Restoration Inventory (OWRI) 
             database. The OWRI database is managed by the Oregon 
             Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB) and originated with the Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds. 
             The majority of OWRI entries represent voluntary actions of private 
             citizens and landowners who have worked in partnership with federal, 
             state, and local groups to improve aquatic habitat and water quality 
             conditions. OWRI is the single largest restoration information database 
             in the Western United States with more than 17,000 completed projects 
             reported since 1995. The database included in this pacakge was sourced from the publically availiable
             OWRI database downloads provided by OWEB. The database was converted
             from Microsoft Access format to a SQLite database. All data and tables
             have been included and are exactly the same.
