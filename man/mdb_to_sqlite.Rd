\description{
Move OWRI tables in a Microsoft Access database into a SQlite database.
All tables are moved exactly as named using their existing column datatypes.
If a table already exists in the SQlite database an error will be returned.
This function is to be used to create new tables in a SQlite database rather
than append or overwrite them.
